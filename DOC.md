## Types of Timelines 
There are three types of Timelines: 
- Structured Timeline: State with object types are copied using structuredClone 
- Unstructured Timeline: States with object types are referenced and can contain references
- Primitive Timeline: Limited types for fast performance, object types are stored as primitives

The config of each timeline defines the **timelineType** which can be changed in real-time. 
It's possble to develop with Structured Timeline Type and change over to Unstructured for production
using the `.setTimelineType('unstructured')`.

There is no hard rule about what type to prefer. "Structured" is the default which will guard against
data usutiable for structured-cloned based APIs like postMessage and IndexedDB, as well as not containing references to external objects. "Unstructured" stores object without the structured-clone algorithm in some cases it may be faster 
but it may also be more privy to external references. "Pruned" is a restricted data type spcifically where performance is a concern.  


## Typed state
- You can enforce the type of state a stateObject accepts for Structured and Unstructured state. 
- In debug mode, you can enabled typed-object-state for plain objects
